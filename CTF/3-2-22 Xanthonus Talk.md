### Things To Think About When Getting Into Security Field

- **Fundamental Research and Whitepapers may definitely be something I want to look into; heavy writing and high-level analysis skills required.

**Common Benefits in Security Field**
  - 401Ks
  - Retirement plans
  - Shares into a company (almost unheard of not to get these when working for small business)
  - RSUs- stock that company's give you
  - ISOs- privilege stock given by small companies
  - Clearance Levels

  **NOTE:** 300=400K salaries are usually paid in cash and stock benefits.

### Government Contracting

- Basically implied that you have to have a master's here.
- Probably will end up in managerial roles in government contracting (Preferable for me).
- These roles will see you leading people, instead of hands-on project.
   - May do something such as proposal writing.

- If you want to do hands on and still be in academia space, you may get that with government contracting.

- An important thing to note is that it is **hard to get out of** government contracting and FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) once you're in these companie's.

### Living Considerations

- Microsoft is always looking for more people to work within their research departments.

- Cost of living plays a big part in job hunting after college.

- Try to settle into where you want to be (location, and job role/company-wise) right after college.
   - This saves time and money, and paves a way for ascension into your desired role.

### Interviewing Considerations

- Interviews are really about hobbies and research (I'm doing Art of Memory Forensics)

- You should apply to positions regardless of cert requirements; companie's often put all these details and specifications that will attract the perfect 'unicorn' for the role- that person is seldom the one they get.
