### Guest Speaker: Patricia (Google Sec. Engineer)
- First we had Patricia come in and talk about the importance of being in this club, and making connections.
- She notes how important networking is, and that by being in this club you are making the right choice.
- She advises to put yourself in the position you want, and to work hard for high-level security positions.
- "yes, technical skills are important, but social skills are also important."
- Basically, aim to grow in all areas.
- The earlier you start, the better - in all aspects related to personal growth.
- "Work hard today, so you don't have to work as hard later."
- If you're gonna foster any kind of addiction, foster an addiction to personal growth.
- Entry level positions reach up to 6 figures if you work hard - this is not unrealistic for security engineer positions.
- Work on your interviewing skills
   - To this effect, you can practice by having someone ask you hypothetical questions that may come up in a scenario of a real interview.
- If you put something on your resume, you should be prepared to defend your prowess in that skill with your life.
- Ex: an example question for a security engineer role would be a question that asks you to script a process/task.

- CV recommendations: 
   - WCSC summer camps, conferences, volunteering events
- They wanna know what CTFs you're doing, writeups, and that kind of stuff.
- **Experience**, not **work experience** is usually what company's are asking for.
