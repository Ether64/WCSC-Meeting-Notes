# Overview of First Blueteam Meeting

-   Setup a virtualized Windows system (Virtualbox or VMware)

- Discussed how to access, change, and monitor important Windows security policies located in 'Computer Management'

- Went over good practices for password policies in windows.

- Briefly talked about Powershell and command prompt usage in Windows.

- Differentiated between Windows and Linux, in terms of operating system functionality, file navigation, and setting configuration. 

- In short, Windows is more GUI-based (graphical user-interface)... you click many buttons and tabs to configure a Windows machine. On the other hand, Linux largely uses terminal (and commands) for file navigation and system configuration.

- Active Directory and Egyptian Pyramids discussed.

- We briefly touched upon the ability to automate common system hardening techniques (configuring password + security policies, and changes/checking user passwords in Windows).

- Basically, all you *really* need to know is that we talked about how to manually conduct system hardening (the root of Blueteam operations)i on Windows machines.
